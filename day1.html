 <b>Tools: Visual
Studio Code</B> </P>
 <A NAME="_GoBack"></A>There
are several development tools to choose from. In COMP 1950 we will
use the open source Integrated Devlopment Environment (IDE) from
Microsoft called   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><b>Visual
Studio Code</B> </A>  (VS Code). This is
more than a simple text editor, it provides robust code editing,
maintenance and testing features, as well as supporting plugins to
further increase it's capabilities. </P>
 <b>Lab Computers</B> </P>
 VS Code should
already be installed on COMP1950 lab computers. The executable is
found at   <b>C:/Program Files/Microsoft
VS Code/Code.exe</B> </P>
 <b>Laptop / Home
Desktop</B> </P>
 <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads"><b>Download
VS Code</B> </A>  for Windows, Mac or
Linux. </P>
 <b>Exploring VS Code</B> </P>
 Your instructor will
demonstrate some of it's capabilities in class. On your own time, you
may wish to review the   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs"><b>help
documentation</B> </A>  'Get Started'
section to give yourself a better understanding of some of the basic
features and functions provided by VS Code. </P>
<ul>
	 <li> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics"><b>Setup
	and basics of VS Code</B> </A></P>
	 <li> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs"><b>VS
	Code help documentation</B> </A></P>
 </ul>
 <b>Tools:
Browser-based development</B> </P>
 There are three
major web browser platforms to consider: </P>
<ul>
	 <li> <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"><b>Mozilla</B> </A></P>
	<ul>
		 <li> This is the
		platform that   <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/"><b>Firefox</B> </A>  runs
		on </P>
		 <li> Mozilla
		Foundation's web platform created by web developers </P>
		 <li> Gecko
		rendering engine: fast and progressive </P>
		 <li> Excellent
		level of standards compliance </P>
		 <li> Corporate
		independence </P>
		 <li> No built-in
		development tools </P>
		 <li> Plethora of
		add-ons that make web development easy </P>
		 <li> Add-ons have a
		downside: bloat </P>
	 </ul>
	 <li> <a href="http://www.webkit.org/"><b>WebKit</B> </A></P>
	<ul>
		 <li> This is the
		platform that gives us   <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome"><b>Chrome</B> </A>,   <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/"><b>Safari</B> </A>and<a href="http://www.opera.com/"><b>Opera</B> </A>,
		with a few other smaller browsers out there as well. </P>
		 <li> Excellent
		platform that is very fast and standards compliant </P>
		 <li> Third parties
		can download the source, make local adjustments and release their
		own version, as Google and Apple have both done </P>
		 <li> Standalone
		version can be downloaded at any time for the latest release </P>
		 <li> Development is
		done via the built-in Developer Tools </P>
		 <li> Initially a
		thin environment, recent releases have made Webkit-based browsers
		excellent for developers </P>
		 <li> Macintosh
		based developers may need to   <a href="http://www.jonhartmann.com/index.cfm/2011/4/28/Enabling-Safari-Developer-Tools"><b>enable
		web developer options</B> </A>  in
		Safari before accessing the developer tools </P>
	 </ul>
	 <li> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/"><b>Microsoft</B> </A></P>
	<ul>
		 <li> The vendor
		for   <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/microsoft-edge"><b>Edge</B> </A>  and   <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/internet-explorer.aspx"><b>Internet
		Explorer</B> </A></P>
		 <li> Microsoft's
		Edge is a major improvement on it's previous browser offerings. </P>
		 <li> Edge offers
		very good standards compliance and browser tools. </P>
		 <li> Do   <b>NOT</B>   use
		Internet Explorer as your development browser. It is one the least
		standards compliant of the browsers. It is also no longer supported
		with updates. </P>
	 </ul>
 </ul>
 Remember to test
your work in as many browsers as you can!   <a href="http://browsershots.org/"><b>BrowserShots</B> </A>  allows
you to do basic testing for earlier versions of Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, and Opera. If you need to test for early iterations of IE,
try:   <a href="http://netrenderer.com/"><b>Netrenderer</B> </A></P>
 <b>Tools: Extensions</B> </P>
 Extensions can add
more functionality and features to your development browser. </P>
 The   <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/"><b>Web
Developer Toolbar</B> </A>  is available
for Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Some useful features include: </P>
<ul>
	 <li> Disable styles
	- by embedded/linked/inline as well as all styles, or just a single
	sheet </P>
	 <li> Edit CSS &amp;
	HTML - Make live changes to your CSS or HTML! </P>
	 <li> Images -
	outlining, file sizes, alt information... lots more </P>
	 <li> Form detail -
	useful for working with form elements </P>
	 <li> Cookie
	examination and manipulation </P>
	 <li> Built in
	validators </P>
	 <li> Line Guides &amp;
	Rulers </P>
	 <li> Element
	inspector </P>
 </ul>
 Search online to see
what is available for your development browser: </P>
<ul>
	 <li> Ad blockers </P>
	 <li> Password
	managers </P>
	 <li> Drawing on HTML
	pages </P>
	 <li> Text to speech </P>
	 <li> Etc, etc! </P>
 </ul>
 <b>Browser Based
Diagnostic Tools</B> </P>
 As web pages get
more complex, it can become difficult figuring out what is going on.
For example, CSS rules that override other CSS rules, if spread
across several files, can be challenge to make sense of. Having a
diagnostic tool to assist in developing will make it easier to
examine every detail of web pages. </P>
 Most modern browsers
have some kind of development environment that can be turned on or
triggered via extensions and/or plug-ins. </P>
 <b>Web Browser Tools</B> </P>
<ul>
	 <li> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/son/docs/Tools"><b>Firefox</B> </A></P>
	 <li> <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/"><b>Chrome</B> </A></P>
	 <li> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/"><b>Safari</B> </A></P>
	 <li> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/f12-devtools-guide"><b>Edge</B> </A></P>
 </ul>
 Get familiar with
using one of these tools. They are invaluable for understanding code
and for finding, diagnosing, and fixing problems with code. You will
be required to use them in the classes ahead. Practice
adding/editing/removing both HTML and CSS using your development
browser's built in tools. </P>
 <b>Typical Features</B> </P>
<ul>
	 <li> <b>F12</B>   key
	will toggle open/close the tools in most browsers </P>
	 <li> The   <b>Elements</B> / <b>Inspector</B>   tab
	provides an overview of the HTML and CSS </P>
	 <li> The   <b>Select</B>   tool
	can be used to analyze the structure of the page and understand he
	status of box models </P>
	 <li> The   <b>Console</B>   will
	display Javascript behaviours and error messages </P>
 </ul>
 <b>NOTE:</B>   changes
you make with the tool are   <b>client
based</B> , and do not affect the server
side HTML/CSS files. Client side changes made with this tool are
temporary (they will be lost upon page refresh). </P>
 The capabilities of
these browser tools go well beyond outlining, examining and editing.
They provide deep troubleshooting capabilities of the HTTP network,
javascript and even XHR (XMLHttpRequest). </P>
 <b>Standards: W3C</B> </P>
 Just as those who
manufacture physical goods are expected to follow the   <a href="http://www.iso.org/"><b>International
Organization for Standards (ISO)</B> </A>,
web developers are expected to adhere to the standards described by
the   <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><b>World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</B> </A></P>
 <b>W3C: World Wide
Web Consortium</B> </P>
<ul>
	 <li> Web standards
	have gone through the same process that the ISO went through </P>
	 <li> Many companies
	see the benefits of interoperability - a few are still &quot;forging
	their own&quot; </P>
	 <li> Many companies
	have standards: Adobe, Microsoft, Apple, Ford, GM </P>
	 <li> Many are
	proprietary standards, and are not supported by other companies </P>
	 <li> W3C - World
	Wide Web Consortium: founded by Tim Berners-Lee to try and uniformly
	put forward standards through a single communication vehicle </P>
	 <li> Leading browser
	makers did not follow, initially </P>
	 <li> Designers were
	'taking sides' in the browser wars: users were losers </P>
	 <li> Most modern
	browsers are fairly standards compliant </P>
 </ul>
 <b>W3C Goals</B> </P>
<OL>
	 <li> <b>Universal
	Access</B> : To make the Web accessible to
	all by promoting technologies that take into account the vast
	differences in culture, languages, education, ability, material
	resources, access devices, and physical limitations of users on all
	continents; </P>
	 <li> <b>Semantic
	Web</B> : To develop a software environment
	that permits each user to make the best use of the resources
	available on the Web; </P>
	 <li> <b>Web of
	Trust</B> : To guide the Web's development
	with careful consideration for the novel legal, commercial, and
	social issues raised by this technology. </P>
</OL>
 Why web developers
should follow W3C standards: </P>
<ul>
	 <li> Your pages will
	be viewable in the largest number of browsers </P>
	 <li> Increase
	interoperability with other clients (search engines, screen readers) </P>
	 <li> Web sites will
	gracefully degrade as support for CSS or other presentation layers
	are absent. </P>
	 <li> Code that
	doesn't follow standards cannot be expected to behave predictably in
	the various web browsers </P>
	 <li> Non standard
	code is hard to support </P>
	 <li> Re-engineering
	and/or maintaining poorly coded websites can be very difficult,
	costly and time consuming </P>
 </ul>
 <b>Discussion:</B> </P>
<ul>
	 <li> What is the
	current W3C recommended version for HTML? </P>
	 <li> What is the
	current W3C recommended version for CSS? </P>
	 <li> What are the
	consequences of using a non-standard version? </P>
 </ul>

 <b>Standards: Web
Development</B> </P>
 <b>Three goals of
standards-driven web development:</B> </P>
<OL>
	 <li> Compatibility
	(creating web pages that work well in all browsers) </P>
	 <li> Portability
	(writing code that works well in any computing environment/operating
	system) </P>
	 <li> Accessibility
	(produce web pages that are optimized for search engines, screen
	readers, etc) </P>
</OL>
 <b>Requirements</B> </P>
<ul>
	 <li> HTML + CSS +
	DOM = Agile Web Sites </P>
	 <li> Structurally
	valid HTML code (eg: tags that open are closed. parent-child tag
	relationships are valid, etc) </P>
	 <li> Logically valid
	HTML code (eg: ids are not applied more than once per page) </P>
	 <li> Syntactically
	valid CSS code </P>
	 <li> Use external
	CSS to develop sites that separate content (HTML) from presentation
	(CSS) </P>
	 <li> Using Semantic
	Markup to establish content relationships and logical deployment of
	content </P>
	 <li> Use a single
	codebase (no browser sniffing, forked code) </P>
	 <li> Consider
	special needs users with screen readers. A common browser used with
	screen reader software is   <a href="http://www.webbie.org.uk/"><b>Webbie</B> </A></P>
 </ul>
 <b>Standards: File
and Folder Naming</B> </P>
 HTTP urls cannot
contain certain characters, and certain characters will cause
unwanted effects and behaviours when used in a url. Follow best
practices for all file and folder names: </P>
<ul>
	 <li> File and folder
	names should   <b>NOT</B>   contain: </P>
	<ul>
		 <li> Capital
		letters </P>
		 <li> Spaces </P>
		 <li> Special
		characters:   <b>! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * (
		) + { } [ ] : ; &quot; &lt; &gt; ? |</B>   etc... </P>
	 </ul>
	 <li> Acceptable
	non-alphanumeric characters:   <b>. _ -
	~</B> </P>
	 <li> Filenames
	should either be descriptive of the file contents, or use the
	default page name:   <b>index.htm</B> ,   <b>index.html</B>   or   <b>index.shtml</B>   (or
	whatever your server default is) </P>
	 <li> Folder names
	should always be descriptive. Folder structure should be logical
	(eg:   <b>/hockey/nhl/canucks</B> ). </P>
 </ul>
 <b>Standards: File
Management</B> </P>
<ul>
	 <li> Including
	an   <b>index.html</B>   file
	in every folder on your server will ensure users cannot go snooping
	around your filesystem. the index.html file can be a blank HTML page
	if you like, as long as the user does not see a list of files when
	they request a folder </P>
	 <li> Browser caching
	can reduce excessive request/response transactions between client
	and server. however, some browsers may cache things like the CSS, so
	if the styles have changed since caching the client may not get the
	latest styles. </P>
	<ul>
		 <li> <b>Ctrl +
		F5</B>   ( <b>Cmd
		+ F5</B>   for Mac) will force a page
		reload. Very useful when developing on a localhost http server. </P>
		 <li> If a file name
		has changed, the browser will have to make a new request from the
		server. versioning your file names will ensure users always have
		the latest version of any file (for example   <b>styles_1.0.css,
		styles_1.1.css, styles_1.2.css, styles_2.0.css</B>   etc) </P>
	 </ul>
	 <li> If there are
	files/pages on your server no longer being used, be sure to either
	remove them or locate them in a place where users are not going to
	accidentally find them </P>
 </ul>
 <b>Standards: Code

are expected to present a readable, well organized code style: </P>
<ul>
	 <li> Comment   <b>all
